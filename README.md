# RESTful_API_Antibody_Storage
A RESTful API created using python, flask, flask_restful and SQLAlchemy. The aim of this API was to practice both creating a RESTful API, and to further my understanding of RESTful APIs. The database stores information on antibody orders that can will be placed, and keeps a record of the date of when the antibody was ordered.

Below I have detailed the different files that are included in this repo, and explain what each part of each file does.
